## Angular $ Wrapper Services

### $document and $window
###### [Style [Y180](#style-y180)]

  - Use [`$document`](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/service/$document) and [`$window`](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/service/$window) instead of `document` and `window`.

    *Why?*: These services are wrapped by Angular and more easily testable than using document and window in tests. This helps you avoid having to mock document and window yourself.

### $timeout and $interval
###### [Style [Y181](#style-y181)]

  - Use [`$timeout`](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/service/$timeout) and [`$interval`](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/service/$interval) instead of `setTimeout` and `setInterval` .

    *Why?*: These services are wrapped by Angular and more easily testable and handle AngularJS's digest cycle thus keeping data binding in sync.
