## Routing
Client-side routing is important for creating a navigation flow between views and composing views that are made of many smaller templates and directives.

###### [Style [Y270](#style-y270)]

  - Use the [AngularUI Router](http://angular-ui.github.io/ui-router/) for client-side routing.

    *Why?*: UI Router offers all the features of the Angular router plus a few additional ones including nested routes and states.

    *Why?*: The syntax is quite similar to the Angular router and is easy to migrate to UI Router.

###### [Style [Y271](#style-y271)]

  - Define routes for views in the module where they exist. Each module should contain the routes for the views in the module.

    *Why?*: Each module should be able to stand on its own.

    *Why?*: When removing a module or adding a module, the app will only contain routes that point to existing views.

    *Why?*: This makes it easy to enable or disable portions of an application without concern over orphaned routes.
