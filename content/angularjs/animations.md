## Animations

### Usage
###### [Style [Y210](#style-y210)]

  - Use subtle [animations with AngularJS](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/animations) to transition between states for views and primary visual elements. Include the [ngAnimate module](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ngAnimate). The 3 keys are subtle, smooth, seamless.

    *Why?*: Subtle animations can improve User Experience when used appropriately.

    *Why?*: Subtle animations can improve perceived performance as views transition.

### Sub Second
###### [Style [Y211](#style-y211)]

  - Use short durations for animations. I generally start with 300ms and adjust until appropriate.

    *Why?*: Long animations can have the reverse affect on User Experience and perceived performance by giving the appearance of a slow application.

### animate.css
###### [Style [Y212](#style-y212)]

  - Use [animate.css](http://daneden.github.io/animate.css/) for conventional animations.

    *Why?*: The animations that animate.css provides are fast, smooth, and easy to add to your application.

    *Why?*: Provides consistency in your animations.

    *Why?*: animate.css is widely used and tested.
