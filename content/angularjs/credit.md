This style guide was initially forked from
[John Papa's AngularJs Style Guide](https://github.com/johnpapa/angularjs-styleguide).

It is an amazing resource, please be sure to check out his original.

## John Papa

If you are looking for an opinionated style guide for syntax, conventions, and structuring AngularJS applications, then step right in. These styles are based on my development experience with [AngularJS](//angularjs.org), presentations, [Pluralsight training courses](http://pluralsight.com/training/Authors/Details/john-papa) and working in teams.

The purpose of this style guide is to provide guidance on building AngularJS applications by showing the conventions I use and, more importantly, why I choose them.

## Community Awesomeness and Credit

Never work in a vacuum. I find that the AngularJS community is an incredible group who are passionate about sharing experiences. As such, a friend and AngularJS expert Todd Motto and I have collaborated on many styles and conventions. We agree on most, and some we diverge. I encourage you to check out [Todd's guidelines](https://github.com/toddmotto/angularjs-styleguide) to get a sense for his approach and how it compares.

Many of my styles have been from the many pair programming sessions [Ward Bell](http://twitter.com/wardbell) and I have had. While we don't always agree, my friend Ward has certainly helped influence the ultimate evolution of this guide.

## See the Styles in a Sample App

While this guide explains the *what*, *why* and *how*, I find it helpful to see them in practice. This guide is accompanied by a sample application that follows these styles and patterns. You can find the [sample application (named modular) here](https://github.com/johnpapa/ng-demos) in the `modular` folder. Feel free to grab it, clone it, or fork it. [Instructions on running it are in its readme](https://github.com/johnpapa/ng-demos/tree/master/modular).
